/// Attach this script to any game object that should match the user's head motion.
/// By default, it continuously updates the local transform to Cardboard.HeadView.
/// A target object may be specified to provide an alternate reference frame for the motion.
///
/// This script will typically be attached to directly to a Camera object, or to its
/// parent if you need to offset the camera from the origin.
/// Alternatively it can be inserted as a child of the Camera and parent of the
/// CardboardEye camera.  Do this if you already have steering logic driving the
/// mono Camera and wish to have the user's head motion be relative to that.  Note
/// that in the latter setup, head tracking is visible only when VR Mode is enabled.
///
/// In some cases you may need two instances of CardboardHead, referring to two
/// different targets (one of which may be the parent), in order to split where
/// the rotation is applied from where the positional offset is applied.  Use the
/// #trackRotation and #trackPosition properties in this case.

  /// steering.  Normally, turning the parent object (i.e. the body or vehicle)
  /// towards the direction the user is looking would carry the head along with it,
  /// thus creating a positive feedback loop.  Use an external target object as a
  /// fixed point of reference for the direction the user is looking.  Often, the
  /// grandparent or higher ancestor is a suitable target.

  ///
  /// This can cause an annoying jitter because Unity, during this `LateUpdate()`
